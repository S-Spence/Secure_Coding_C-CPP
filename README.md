# Secure_Coding_C-CPP
This repository stores assignments from a secure coding course for my undergraduate program. The course focused on secure coding in C and C++.
</br>
</br>
<ul>
  <lh>Assignments</lh>
  <li>Encryption assignment using XOR encryption</li>
  <li>Unit testing for secure coding</li>
  <li>Excpetions in C++</li>
  <li>Static code analysis of buggy code using CPPCheck. The XML file and corresponding analysis are in a zip folder. </li>
</ul>
</br>
</br>
The final project for the course was a security policy for a theoretical company. The security policy can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9o2qjUcBDH1NAI6yzLR3i8z5294ZvHBHknuxbjAIFc/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>

A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXrag4p-264">YouTube Presentation</a> of the security policy is also available.
